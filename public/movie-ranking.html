<hr>
<h3>Moulin Rouge</h3> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/moulin-rouge-2001/"><img src="../assets/images/Affiche Spectacle.jpeg" alt="moulin rouge poster" width="150"></a>
<p>
    it's a very beautiful musical comedy written by baz luhrmann one of my 
    favorite director who talks about bohemian love and the life of an artist 
    as well as the deprevation and the nonchalance of the 50s with all 
    the vintage and the sweetness that this era paints under 
    a fresco as dark and luminous as the city of lights could be

<h3>Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban</h3> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban/"><img src="../assets/images/Harry Potter et le Prisonnier d'Azkaban - 2004.jpeg" alt="harry potter 3 poster" width="150"></a>
<p>
    I really like this film it's a film with which I grew up and developed 
    my love for the saga directed by none other than alfonso cuar√≥n a director 
    who gave this childish saga a wind of frankness and noiceur which inked 
    this mythology in our hearts
</p>
<h3>Memento</h3> <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/memento/"> <img src="../assets/images/memento polaroid poster.jpeg" alt="memento poster" width="150"></a>
<p>

    batman the dark knight the prestige and so on it was difficult for me to choose 
    a film that stood out, however Memento are for me one of these best film
